<specsKey="review1">I bought a Nikon camera last week (ordered on 10-09-2014 to be precise). Disappointed to say that i am not satisfied with flipkart. The reason is, I ordered this camera just because there was an 8GB SD card on offer. But when i got the actual product, it was packaged with a 4GB SD card. When enquired with flipcart customer care, I was told that the offer (8GB SD) was from Thursday (11-09-2014) onwards.  But i am 200% sure that when i placed the order, it was displayed with 8GB card on offer from 10-09-2014 onwards. To be honest, you have put a very bad taste in my mouth. I didnt expect this kind of response from a company like flipkart.  Unfortunately i dont have any proof to show that the 8GB offer was there from 10-09-2014 onwards. But as a customer, I am very disappointed  I don't want to lie here as i know that what ever i said is 100% accurate.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">I received my order for this camera a few days ago....... I am really satisfied with flipkart service as the delivery was made one day before the expected date. This a a very nice product at a very low price. Its features include Smile Timer, Blink Proof alerting and Red-Eye Fix. Videos are recorded in 720p. It takes very sharp images in daylight and indoors. One of the cons of this camera is that low light photography is a bit blurry but still decent. A 4GB SDHC card is provided along with the camera. I would surely recommend this camera to my friends........</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">Nikon company gave along with the camera a memory card, charger with rechargeable batteries and a carry pouch. I din't receive the memory card. This is not right. Flipkart didn't bother to solve this. I even checked in the local market. The bundle offer is still available with my local dealer. I will tell you very clearly you have left a bad taste in my mouth.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">I was scared at first, as i had never made an investment in cameras before. But i decided to go with the trusted brands of Nikon and Flipkart.  Delivery took 3 days and I was fine with that. The Camera came with all essentials - batteries, charger, a pouch, memory card. I used it the very next day on a field trip to Qutb Minar and I was very happy with the picture quality and the ease with which one can use it.  Also, the recording feature is excellent. We started shooting when a group of Qawals started singing and it was awesome.  I am very satisfied with the product. Thanks</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">1. The product is no frills camera, which does what is says 2. Has Auto and Easy Auto mode and macro mode also for extreme close up 3. Day shots are good but night shots are not upto the mark 4. Video recording is good 5. It does not have a voice controller during recording. 6. Can set photos to be of various sizes eg, 4,8 or16 mp 7. Megapixel don't really matter since optical zoom is a very normal 5x 8. Main objective is to take photos inside house or in some parties. Dont expect to take fast moving pictures. 9. Has a tripod stand and the flash is powerful. Maybe 5-8 feet in dark, images will get captured.  10. Prices vary for camera color, with silver color ones normally the cheapest. 11. There is a separate video recording button, which starts immediately on clicking it. No in between pausing of video recording possible. So each time you have to stop and so new file will get created.  12. Has a wifi kind of icon displayed on screen. But has no wifi connectivity.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">I ordered this camera after reading reviews that its good enough for 4k. Got the product today and its my first digital camera. Pictures look fine and its good enough for the price.  However packing by flipkart was below average. No plastic air bags or bubble wrapping was provided. The camera (within Nikon's packing) was stuffed along with other items (case, chargeable batteries). Given the product being electronic goods one would expect better handling from flipkart.  As mentioned in the offer i got the case, chargeable batteries + charger and 8GB card.  Hope flipkart will not make packing blunders and will provide at least some cushion to electronic goods so a user wont have to face any issues.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">I ordered this camera for my aunt and received it with excellent packing. If you re looking for a digi camera for beginners then go for it... Excellent product with 16.1 megapixel with which you can click pictures like anything.. Easy adjustable for all conditions and suitable modes. Screen display was also too good!! No doubt .. you can go for it..</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">It is a nice cute little camera. It is smaller than what we see in this picture. It is very easy to use and pictures are clear. But I felt like it is a little flimsy compared to my old Canon. I think I should not expect more for Rs.3800/- :)  WSRetail packaging was NOT up to the mark this time.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">Really Good Product Value for Money.. i like it...  i recommended this product who need good camera with low budget</specsKey>
