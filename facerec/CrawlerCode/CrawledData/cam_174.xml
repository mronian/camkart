<specsKey="review2">Hi, The product seems promising but NOT the service from flipkart. I ordered this camera on 14th Mar and I was told that I would get it in 2-3 days. I recieved a PHILIPS EPILATOR !!!!!! to my surprise. The bill which was in the corrier box was addressing correctly + the amount and product name. But the product in the box IS different. When Talked to customer care, they told me that they will revert with what I have ordered by 21st Mar.  Package - Poor. Worst. Could peep from the corners of the box. HAve pics taken the time Its been handed over to me. If required can pass on. lemme know.  Really disappointed with Flipkart as I was NOT expecting this from it. Would like to look forward for my product soon.  Thank you. Vishala Bengaluru</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">This is a useless camera for me. IT is slow in processing the picture, my Nokia E71 will process faster than this. Purchase it as my earlier Kodak Camera (Free with Printer) was broken. I still miss that camera  The offer and goodies were good but thing twice before purchasing this camera, as during your good moments you might get frustrated as Flash will not work, will be very slow.</specsKey>

<specsKey="review5">I bought it a few days ago from flipkart and trust me it is really a good buying.20 megapixel and that too within 6000k is something that is indeed praiseworthy for Nikon as the other rivals failed to offer such,maximum of which may be of 16 megapixel.I have always been a fan of Nikon from the beginning and going by the performance till now i am truly satisfied.Crystal clear picture quality with 5x zoom.Gives True HD pictures when you connect it via data cable to laptop.You need not have to install anything.Just plug in the cable via a usb port to the camera and that's it.May be the use of AA pencil batteries may sound a little bit old-fashioned,but it is indeed suitable as you don't have to recharge it now and then.Just carry it as a back up and when the other batteries are down,you have the options to use them.And to say about after maintenance,you all know Nikon excels in it's service.They have a dedicated after maintenance service.And to say about Flipkart's delivery,it was good.Good packaging and on time delivery within 2-3 days.So guys,go for it without giving a second thought as it would be a worth buying.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">It take 2-3 seconds to get the focus right and you misses the timing for the perfect moments.Better stay away from this .Useless 20 Mp sensor.better oo any sony or canon or 8 MP Smartphones</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">i bought this product after reading many reviews but was shocked to see the actual product in hand. The body is made up of very cheap material compared to Fujifilm cameras, the 20 mp actually doesnt look like its 20 mp</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">Now this time thanks to Flipkart service got camera with in 24 hours. But price is higher than other websites.  + ve points .. 1, Very Nice quality 20 mp , 5152*3864   2. Motion sensor, You can take snap of rotating fan without any blurriness.  3. It start just in 1 sec.  4. Eye-fi technology  5 . it use AA battery.    -ve Point : It take about 15 second to get ready to take next snap</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">I had ordered Nikon Coolpix L28 (Black) on Sunday 22 Sep 2013 and by Tuesday afternoon 24 Sep 2013 it was delivered. Awesome delivery service by Flipkart and WS retail team. Regarding the products was delighted to get freebies like 4 GB memory card, Camera Pouch with Nikon logo, strap, Extra pair of batteries (rechargeable) and a cool Timex wrist watch. The camera has 20 MP CCD sensor and 5X optical Zoom. I clicked few Pics and Picture quality and color reproduction was good. However the picture looks grainy on camera Screen. It was easy to transfer the Pics from camera to my Desktop. I tried Zoom feature at low light and was delighted with its quality of snap taken. Also did HD recording and it captured excelled video recording with zoom facility. The photo file size is in around 4.5 MB and about 1 minute video takes 100 MB size. Of the 11 Pics that I clicked 6 turned out super sharp, 2 good quality , 1 average and 2 were blur and hence not as expected. These shots were taken in Auto mode. Overall a good point and shoot for day to day use.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review10">Hiii all, I have purchased Nikon Coolpix L28 in month of october. First when i received this product, this was not as described on website. Thanks to Flip Kart they returned that. When i received another replaced camera Nikon coolpix L28, its speed is too much slow. I thought it may be due to setting.. but till today, Its speed is too slow. When i take a pic and pose for another then the time in two click is much larger and believe me too harashing, when you are with cam of 20mgpxl but taking too much time. I want to replace but they are not doing for same. I have decided not to buy any product by flip kart coz they only sold bad product.</specsKey>
