<specsKey="review1">I got to know that not all camera sold by Flipkart are entertained for warranty due to camera serial number not find genuine. So please register your camera with company and check your warranty. If any body found any issue let post here for other to be careful.  This is what was communicated to me today by Nikon customer care.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">I ordered this item to W.S.Retail with normal delivery time span on 16/09/2014 at 12.55 P.M and delivered on 17/09/2014 at 10.00 A.M, Just in 21 hours. First of all thanks to flipkart and W.S.Retail for quick shipping. Packing was good. Now comes to Nikon D5300, its my first DSLR camera of my life. My experience with this camera is amazing. Excellent picture quality and sharpness. Even in low light result are impressive. It comes with wi-fi, download nikon app. on yours mobile and share photo on the go. Go for it without any hesitation. Its come with 2 year warranty but i don't know Nikon India accept W.S.Retail invoice as a warranty or not.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">I'm going to take some time to address the warranty issues that everyone seems to be so concerned about. As soon as I received the invoice for my purchase, the first thing I did was to register the product on the Nikon India website. Unfortunately, the S/N provided on the invoice gave me an invalid serial number error on the website. I was a little spooked due to this. I immediately called up Nikon customer care to clarify and they asked me to take the DSLR to the nearest Nikon service center and get it verified. However, upon further observation, I realized that the S/N provided on the invoice was for the Nikkor lens, and not for the DSLR body. There are 2 different S/N, one for the body and one for the lens, and you have to register them separately. I was finally able to register both the body and the lens on Nikon's website and breathed a sigh of relief.  So, here are some pointers - while Nikon has advised against buying from Flipkart, I would first ask you to check the invoice the moment you get it. It should contain a mention of the serial number of the product (any one will do since it's unique) and carry the TIN/CST no. of the seller as well. These two things will help you verify a genuine invoice. Secondly, register your product immediately with Nikon India. If it throws an invalid S/N error, you'll know that it's not a genuine product. Alternatively, it could be that the product S/N has not been updated with Nikon India yet. In this case, you can take the product to your nearest Nikon service center and get the product verified from there.  Finally, and most importantly, note that Nikon DSLR sold by an authorized dealer will have a serial number starting with 7. This is true for all Asian countries except Japan. Mine starts with 7 as well. And my Nikkor lens's S/N starts with 2.  If all these things check out, then I don't think you need to be worried about warranty.  As for the DSLR itself, I don't think I need to praise it any more than some of the reviewers already have. It's a fantastic camera with great picture quality and the built-in WiFi is a boon! Before going for this, I was going to get the Canon 60D, but the Nikon D5300 has better picture quality, more features, is a newer model, has built-in WiFi and GPS, a larger display and is cheaper than the Canon 60D. One downside is the battery; it can only capture ~600 shots on a full charge compared to the ~1100 on the 60D. But I think 600 shots in a day is more than enough. I recommend using the viewfinder as compared to LiveView to save battery.  All in all, I would highly recommend the D5300 to anyone looking to foray into the amazing world of DSLRs. This camera is definitely the way to start that photography career that you have been dreaming of for so long. :p</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">After using more then four month I am in love with it and definitely you will also be. Features those were impressive and helpful in day to day photography. 1. Vari-angle TFT Monitor : you need not be on your knees even for ground/ child shots.  2. Absence of Low Pass Filter : resultant highly sharp images  3. In built Wi-Fi : Control this camera with smart phone. Live view, focus and click images with mobile. Instant download to mobile directly from camera. No need to go back to your system to upload pics on social site. just click and upload.  4. Best color capture in images  5. It works best with Nikon AF-S 50mm prime lens. Best for portraits. (You can simply skip buying to kit lens i.e. Nikon 18-55mm cause once you work with prime lens you will never gonna use kit lens)  6. 24 MP Sensor : Even after cropping images in ur system it gives superb results cause 24MP is more then we need. So once you capture a moment it help in retouch.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">Am a healthcare professional who is also an amateur photographer. I was looking to get a dslr with high resolution and the latest specs. I enjoy holiday photography which include scenery, landscapes, historical sites and portraits.  After much research and analysis, finally decided on the Nikon d5300.  Pros:  24.3 megapixels gives u razor sharp images with amazing clarity.  Transfer to iPhone or iPad using built in WIFI is brilliant for uploading to social websites!  U can also use the same to take pictures as a remote control. This is possible with the nikon app that you can download for all platforms including android and iOS. I particularly like this feature as it is amazing to use ur iPhone to see the images u want to take pictures of and click ur phone to shoot them remotely!!! This alone along with the others makes it a must buy for all gadget freaks!  39 point autofocus, swivel screen, various effects, carbon fibre body shell making it extra light. The list goes on and on!  When it comes to taking pictures, it is brilliant. Beginners and amateurs can use it to point and shoot in auto mode and the pics r brilliant! Semi pros and professionals can play with the apertures and exposure rates and render mind blowing pics!  Kit came with Nikkor AFS 18-55 lenses. Picked up a prime lens AFS Nikkor 35mm. This is enough for both landscapes (18mm for wide angle) and portraits (35mm) Pics r extremely sharp with the 35mm lenses! This kit can be expanded with telephoto lenses for advanced photographers.   If you are looking for something to point and shoot but want pictures like the pros but also want something to pick up for future expansion to a professional level.. Just go for the D5300!!!  Cons: Will post if I can find something..  Best of all, I got it for the lowest price in India, thanks to Flipkart!!! Amazing product, well packaged and delivered in two days flat! Splendid!!!!  Keep it up guyz!!!!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">For a long time, I had planned on buying a DSLR and so would scour the internet for hours. After fixing a minimum budget, I had planned to buy a camera below 30k, and it was mostly going to be Nikon since for the price the quality of cameras by the company would be great. However, time came, when the D3300 came out and the thought of increasing my budget came into being. From there it went to buying a D5200 (after recommendation from a photographer friend) and that was when the D5300 began to entice me. The price difference was slight and the features and specs, way too many! For the price on Flipkart, the camera is excellent and a wonderful buy. Best price in the market (even today, I literally scanned every website for this). If you wish to buy a camera that will last you for years and has amazing quality, specs and features, the D5300 is it! The Wifi features makes this camera one to reckon with, and well, there are so many other features that make this one of the best at the price.   PS Keep checking Flipkart and keep your fingers crossed. The price fluctuates a LOT. It was for about 57k once, when I finally bought it, I got it for 51k. Last time I saw, the price was around 47,000. So buy it the minute it touches the least price.  Also, Kudos to Flipkart. The camera was delivered to me the very next day from the day I placed my order!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">I tried to purchase this camera from WS retails but dropped the idea after checking Nikon India website which clearly says WS Retail is not authorised by Nikon and warranty may be at risk. I wish Flipkart and WS Retail should talk with Nikon and give a clear picture to its customers.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">Does this product really comes under Nokia India Warranty? I have seen Nokia website, it says eCommerce websites like flipkart are not our authorized partners/dealers in India for Nikon Products, we advised you to check the warranty entitlements while buying from online portals.  Is it correct?</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">Received the camera today just as promised by Flipkart. Considering that I live in a tier 3 city, the camera was delivered in just 4 days.  Enough has been said about the camera elsewhere and professional reviews are available.  I was worried about whether the item would get damaged in transit. There was not even a scratch on the box, what to say of the contents. Great packing by Flipkart.  Instead of a 4GB card as mentioned I was pleasantly surprised with an 8GB card. The camera bag is basic though. The camera deserves a better bag. But who can argue with a free item?  I had searched everywhere, other online sites and local retailers. It is cheapest on Flipkart.  If you want this camera, buy it here with your eyes closed.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review10">My wife bought me d5300 two days ago from Flipkart. The seller was WS-Retail. I was so happy getting my first DSLR. Everything was fine in the package. The camera was good. All the accessories were good. Got a 8 GB class 10 mem-card. But when I put the battery into the charger the LED blinked for 2-3 minutes then turned off. I checked the battery status in the camera and it indicated low(not able to use the shutter). According to the manual, it should take almost 110 minutes to charge fully. And while charging the charger LED will blink and when finished(i.e. fully charged) it will glow solid. But in my case, not even the LED is turning on. I am very upset. My wife has started a return request. Don't know what WS Retail will do. But its a kind request to them if they could change the battery charger or the battery(I am confused between which one is actually faulty) it will be good. I liked the camera very much so my wife bought it. But this bad experience on the start has made me feel bad. In fact I relied most of the time on WS-Retail because of their good service and good products(even if some times other sellers are selling in a bit low price, I preferred WS-Retail), but this is a first bitter experience in buying products from them.</specsKey>
