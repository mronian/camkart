<specsKey="review1">First thanks for flipcart , they delivered in 3 days ( on diwali ) . but mentioned time was 6-7 days but got 4 days earlier ,good job. Now we have a good e-shopping guy in india.  The camera is very light and small , you can keep it in pocket and wont feel that its heavy . The pic quality is ok , not so great indoor pics you need to be careful else it will get blur , out door pics are good ( i am comparing it with my canon sx230hs , not fair to compare 15 K with 5.5 K ) .   the battery charger is in built so you dont need to carry one charger ( unless you want a spare battery and charge ).   the card i got as free with this is class - 4 ( kind of useless ) , it takes lot of time to save pic ( pic to pic time is ~5 second ) , better to give a 2 gb but higher speed . buy a class - 10 ( 30 mbps write speed )card.  Overall its value for money and can take pics on any occasion with auto mode ( ladies , kids who don't want or don't know how to play with control )</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">Its really a good camera with Panorma Assistance. i got this cam from Nikon outlet with Paker Pen, Tripod Stand, Card Reader, Screen Gaurd. all in 5800 only. This is really a very good camera with very good deal. Love it :)</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">Nikon lens are always the best... Very sleek, color is stunning... packing is damage proof... can connect directly to d TV and watch snaps n videos. Good clarity.. Zoon is great.. Face detection gives good personal snaps. carrying case is very stylish...</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">This is my first digital camera so m very much excited for taking hands on it. Previously i have Kodak reel camera, but now these types of camera are going to be extinct as their place is taken all n all by point n shoot cameras.  Talking about this camera - First of all, floral design look on this camera is awesome. great picture quality however video is not that much but its good. Battery life is also great! It has different functions and scene selection options for better photography. Its UI and buttons are very easy to use.  All n all its one of the best cameras in this range. I am a newbie in using these cameras so for me its more than what i want :)</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">Bought this as an entry level Camera for my daughter. What made this stand apart from some of the other camera options was the Lithium battery as compared to rechargeable pencil cells offered by most other entry level cameras.  Already own a Nikon DSLR - so the Nikon quality was already proven. Overall - I would recommend this over almost all other entry level cameras. And its availability in my daughters favorite color was another factor in its favor.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">The camera is very stlyish, slim and is very easy to carry, the quality of the picture is also very good, better than Sony Cybershot. Overall the product is worthy.  About fflipkart, the service is very fast and very good. We Expect the same in future. Overall I am very happy with the service of Flipkart. Thankyou very much to the Flipkart Team.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">I bought this camera a month ago , its fun clicking pics all with HD. It has a special 5x wide optical zoom.It has 14 MP. The features are GR8. It has Li-ion battery which minimumly gives 2-3 hours to enjoy. It has auto scene selector mode which allows to click pics very minorly.It also come in some impressive colors which gives it a neat and beautiful look. Just one thing is there which creats problem, thats its voice quality.I was recording sumthing from TV ,but when I saw the video i was not able to hear it properly.Sound could be heard but u have to open ur ears wide to hear it. Allover its a decent camera and if u r looking for a cam buy this,u'll be impressed !!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">Nikon Coolpix S2600 is One of the Best Digital Cameras by Nikon... ___________________________  Always Remember Nikon Gives you a real image, without any extra effects..

<specsKey="review9">Brought this about an year ago.have had no issues with it so far.A sure shot recommendation for those planning to buy the same.Had brought a Fujifilm from Flipkart earlier in the same range which turned out be a not so good product.</specsKey>
