<specsKey="review1">This is my 4th Online buy from flipkart i got my cam to the very nxt wrkng day itself, i bought this camera for my sister the camera is very sleek and easy to handle and its very simple and the pics are very gud wen compared other models in the same price.The zoom is very excellent and pics which i took in night are as same as dat i took in the day time there are many modes wch we can use and take pics in very diff styles.....8/10 for the product.  I got one camera bag,camera pouch,Two rechargeable batteries with charger and a 4GB card im very happy and as usual 10/10 to flipkart.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">Ordered it on a wednesday at 5.30 am & got it delivered to my address in the afternoon a day later having all the contents in proper order & condition.  Well,on coming to the camera I must say that it is one of the most basic ones u get in market but the best too ,,,, changing the properties of the brightness,exposure and other specs is not allowed apart from the presets which aren't too good ... so not a good buy for Pros.  Go for a better Cam with more flexiblities.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">bought this camera as a gift. Great price (and freebies) and super fast delivery by Flipkart. When received, found the SD CARD missing, but rest of the package was in perfect condition. Flipkart had the memory card sent immediately without an fuss upon my request.   Overall a good experience.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">I have been using this product for more than 6 months now. I didn't purchase this product from Flipkart but thought of writing a review with my experience. Nikon L23 offers a high 5x optical zoom but don't ever go for the zoom to ruin your pictures. Extremely worse quality pics in little low light and indoors. The image stabiliser is almost useless. Takes a lot of effort to take a photo in even 2x zoom,the pic gets distorted almost everytime i take a pic with zoom. Low priced and cool looks but also very low performance. Try not to go for this cam unless you are impressed by its outer looks and pricing. Pros : More zoom Cool looks Low price Cons : Extremely bad picture quality Useless image stabiliser Low mp of 10</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">At 5k This camera is good. Nice picture quality and features. But its made up of low quality plastic. I broke a a tiny chip off the battery covering lid and was told by the service center that I need to pay 3000/- as they need to change entire body ! all this happened within 3 months of buying the camera.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">Hey all, I jus wanna thank FLIPKART for their wonderful services. I ordered n got it delivered in a day. Woooowwww...tats amazing!! :)Abt d Coolpix - its really cool as d name takes it away..too gud for d price u pay...i had gifted it for my parents wedding day...my father had took pics n he loved it totally.....Thank u Nikon! :) Dear Flipkart, I Love U!! :)))</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">A good camera for a person who is just entering photography field. Light weight, powered by AA battery, clear display, so many automatic per-programmed function that gives user-friendly touch...  Pros:  * Gud model and great value for money as a starter.  * Freebies included Carry-case, charger and rechargeable   battery, memory card, designer watch and pen. Cons:  * optical zoom is only 5X, no other go bcoz in this price   range longer is not possible.  * rechargeable charger and battery is not from Nikon, its   from other company, any have the is good only working   good till now, so user don't expect nikon charger and   battery.  Last But Not Least---- Hats off to Flip-kart packaging, its really nicely packed and delivered in-time..</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">picture quality is very good. flesh is awesome for night images. more than 17 modes of operation. zooming feature is quite good. over all a best buy for the price range. if you are not looking for a reliable cam from nikon or canon then this product is the best buy for anything less than 5000...</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">Bought this camera as a gift for my sister. The initally shipped camera had some heating problem and the battery drained off when the camera was in switched-off condition. Reported the problem to flipkart and to my great pleasure the guys arranged a replacement in 4-5days to reach me. Really pleased with flipkart. Kudos As for the cam, a nice cam really. Shoots amazing pics though an antiblur mode is seriously missing. An image stabilisation problem is there in pics taken in certain modes esp without flash. Overall rating 5/5 as value for money. Go for it.</specsKey>
