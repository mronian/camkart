<specsKey="review1">The product is packed with huge amount of specification but none of this of use. 21 MP camera at such a low price was doubtful but I took chance and it proved that low price can not accomodate the higher configurations. Pictures gets blurred after zooming even upto 3X. Flash is not that much effective as it should have.  Looks cute and handy and easily fits in the hands but the picture quality is a huge dissappointment.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">This is my first digital camera. I brought many product from flipkart. Really Flipkart is great. It took only 4 days to delivered. Camera is very good, stylish. I also get a gift watch from NIKON. Love you Flipkart</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">excellent camera .. huge number of features in a very low budget .. picture quality is too good .. thanks to nikon</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">This was my first buy from flipkart.... n was really happy receiving such a great device. It had more than I have expected. Really owns a variety of modes to click scenes and very nice image quality. Has good video recording. Moreover, has slim and smart look, light-weighted, easy to carry and handle. Just love it. :)</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">A good camera creates good quality images good for beginners and easy to handle .......</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">great camera at this price, I bought this camera 1 year back,  nikkor lens are gud,autofocus is best, great clarity,  night mode is gud it has smart mode which is best for the non photographers coz it can adjust very well accordingly to the light sensitivity , i'll recommend this product at this price range...!!!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">Easy to use and good quality pictures and a good compact camera. Charging the battery has to be done with the camera which is a little inconvenient.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">It is awesone picture quality, bettry backup, clearty, colour resolution etc. all are very good. And 20 MP camera is such a low price is unbelievable. I must say if any body looking for cemera of this range just buy it blindly.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">I got this at 5.9k , it has lot of features , but camera is slow when deleting images abd processing the pictures apart from that it sgood</specsKey>
<specsKey="review10">Perfect Product according to the Price... I have given Rs. 6300 through Cash on delivery which Includes free gift as 4 GB Memory Card & a Pouch...</specsKey>
