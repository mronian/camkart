<specsKey="review1">I have been using olympus TG2 for underwater shooting...this camera was jus taken to supplement the TG2 in case of battery drain.....the S32 produces good image quality at lower ISOs but the images are grainy when it crosses ISO 400.....the images are not that sharp and have contrast on darker side... IF you have to consider a camera for family outings then this one is best rugged camera...but for people indulged in more rugged sports like hiking, squba diving,etc consider OLYMPUS TG2 or NIKON AW1000 series cams.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">Ok as a toy (but, too expensive at ~5.5k) for kids. Mobile phones take better photos. SD card slot is flimsy, doesn't recognize card sometimes- probably a manufacturing defect, I'm yet to take it to service center. Overall unsatisfied with what it offers for the price I paid.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">I am using it for past few months, but the enthusiasm with which i purchased was gone!!   Pros: Only one is that its very sturdy one, i dropped from 5 feet many time and also put it under running water. Still it works fine.  Cons: 1)The quality of images is very very poor, i had a sony P&S model which was purchased some 10 years back and which is of 5MP, and its images are much better than this. (The reason i believe is that there is a protective glass for lens, and it might be cause for the distortion) 2) Battery backup is very less, and images tend to get poorer when charge drops. 3) Just above 50% of zoom the focus seems to be lost. Overall i'm disappointed with the camera</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">If you are beach person or Loves to spend your holidays in water park or Swimming Pool.   This is the best product for you and your family.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">Really happy with the camera. It has really vibrant colors and my friends are really surprised to see a camera this cheap to have good photo quality.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">The product has some really good features, but they are just good on paper as the performance is absolutely below par. Cons: 1. 13.2 Mp, doesn't even give results my 11 year old Sony digicam with 4.0Mp gives. 2. The picture quality is absolutely poor 3. The camera goes out of focus when the final picture is shot, thus 90% of the pictures that i have shot are completely out of focus and blurred. I have tried all kinda settings to improve on tat. Have kept it aside, thinking to return it   havent tried underwater or in rains to check the results as i am planning to return it.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">We were searching for a camera to work underwater and it's just perfect for it!  We are not professional divers but for a casual trip under the sea this camera is just great!  Loved its features and the colour is cool too!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">hey guys, i just bought this cam yesterday(29/8/2014). the packaging was good. as i expected the cam is small and easy to take pics in one hand. and this cam is WATERPROOF. so you no need to worry take it out in rain or wen you go for swimming. as this is a point and shoot cam. it is having a auto zoom only. where you cannot manually zoom it. but still this cam takes a very great pics for this price bracket.  as i always be travelling or in wort conditions always. i want all my stuff to be waterproof. so i wanted basic cam with this feature. and am really happy for this cam. pros: small and handy. price is less for a waterproof cam nice pixels with optical zoom for this price flash is superb :) lcd screen also is good.  cons: i dont have any but still it could have been little more optical zoom.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">Pros:  1) nice 13 mp photos 2) point and shoot, easy to use, can use along with a dslr. 3) waterproof and shockproof  Cons:  1) the actual colour is milky-whitish, not grey-metallic I expected. 2) night time photo quality is not good (as with most normal cameras)</specsKey>
<specsKey="review10">Flipkart service was prompt.  The Camera. well for the price it seems pretty good. The only issue is that the display of the camera is not up to the mark. The pictures are noisy on the cam screen but seem pretty well once you view them on the PC   The HDMI connection is BAD. I have a 32" LED TV and when I streamed a video / image via the cam using HDMI, the images looked pretty bad.   The Cam is indeed waterproof and takes excellent pictures underwater. The battery life is pretty good too.  The cam is a little slow sometimes when you clicka picture with flash.</specsKey>
