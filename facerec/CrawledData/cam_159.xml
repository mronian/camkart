<specsKey="review1">Nikon S6200 is a good camera at the price its price band. It clicks excellent images in terms of clarity & vivid colour. You actually do not need to use the flash even when you are taking pictures under normal room light at night, only thing is your hands has to be steady, so do the object. The camera response is bit slow and recovery time after one shot is quiet long. This may not matter unless one is going for wildlife photography. At the same time the camera has very good image stabilizer and I had taken beautiful snaps while traveling on a jeep in jungle safari...:) Night mode is also really sensitive. The camera has a good battery life and 4GB memory card will suffice to cover one trip. Optical and digital zooms are also good, but one need to have some experience to click good pictures with digital zoom.  Overall its a good camera with very slim and handy design. Still if one can afford little more money and size weight is not a critical issue then Nikon L120 is a better option.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">I have purchased this cam 4 months before.within this 4 months its got repaired 3 times.it has lot of problems with the battery and power. and even the flash was not working properly, i went to Nikon care they replaced it which costs 5600 Rs....! it was within warranty so i didn't paid anything but just think what would happen if it was out of warranty...!! 5600 Rs flash rate and around 9000 cam...!! Nikon service is too poor...</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">this is by far the best camera in 11000 range. all its features are amazing but no panaroma photo shoot is a dissapointment. otherwise, the best available in market in a range of upto 14000 rs.  i just bought this camera and i am in love with it :*</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">It's a nice camera, easy to use & carry. With 10x zoom & 16 MP, it is a best buy in this Price range. Also, one need not remove the battery for rechange, can be charged with USB port compatibility, that is, it can be charged while moving even from ur car stereo USB Port.........</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">I had the misfortune of buying one. I was impressed by the Nikon brand name of film cameras..but it is a disapointment. Average image quality, poor video quality. The parts are so delicate that the charging jack(with which USB cable for recharge/replay is conected( got damaged within a week and the service centre refused to attend. For a 10000 worth of camera they wanted 6500 to repair... sheer loot. The recharge time of flash and picture saving is also too long. Biggest mistake - opt for Sony instead</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">NOT SATISFIED WITH OVERALL PERFORMANCE... ITS COMPACT AND FUNCTIONS ARE OK...BUT ZOOMED CLICKS ARE NOT UP TO THE MARK... OK FOR THOSE WHO ARE USING CAMERAS OCCASIONALLY... BEFORE THIS CAMERA I WAS USING CANON SX120.. IT WAS NOT COMPACT BUT PERFORMANCE WAS AWESOME...</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">hi this is babu i am very satisfied with this Nikon Coolpix6200, working good, USB Charging is advantage, i don't connect charger when i download it will charge automatically, clear Zoom, nice product and Quick delivery.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">This is a good camera. Its has 10x optical zoom. What I like most is macro. Grid line make it easy to capture professional pictures. If used with little experience you can beat SLR quality. It has Panorama but don;t have motion panorama, It means you have assamble the images using provided s/w , Good one.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">I had purchased this camera in Dec 2011 for my wedding and honeymoon pictures to be captured.It's easy to handle and the operations are quite user friendly (in my case I had previously used a nikon point n shoot hence may be I felt it familiar). But I have been very much dissapointed with the battery life of this camera cause even I had charged it for the entire night, the battery drained by evening and I missed to capture many of my memorable moments(it was quite embarassing when I asked people to click our pics and the battery died). The picture quality is also average (Not good in comaprison to Sony point n Shoot cameras). I regret for opting Nikon over Sony.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review10">I ordered this camera about a week back. It was delivered timely. I took numerous photos with it. Landscapes, close-ups, high-zoom, cloudy pics, dusty weather. It really shined across all tests I laid before it. But the video quality is not good. Even some phones in the range of 10-15k have better video quality. There were artifacts & the video wasn't crisp or sharp.   Buy it for the superb still shots. If you're looking for video recording feature then look elsewhere.</specsKey>
