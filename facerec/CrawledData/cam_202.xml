<specsKey="review1">This camera i brought it from Flipkart after checking it at GK Vale stores, the camera has lot of features which i am still exploring.  Thanks to Flipkart for the offer they provided with the camera, the 2GB Philips GoGear MP3 player.  Pros: 1. Very good point and shoot camera, has lot of features. 2. Worth the price. 3. Zoom is very good (18x optical)  Cons: 1. Only problem, is the memory card provided. Because of which the camera used to freeze often when taking pictures.  For this reason i brought a Class 10 Memory Card (Sandisk Extreme Class 10 8GB card) and now i have not faced the freezing issues.   I request Flipkart/Nikon to provide better memory card than the one which is being provided currently.  Regards, Channabasanna S</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">I bought this camera last week from Flipkart.No problems with either the order or the delivery but unfortunately the product is far from satisfactory.  The camera comes loaded with features with the 18x optical zoom being its USP but inexplicably it just freezes up without a reason.You could be taking a snap on the auto mode or the scene selector mode or the night mode or maybe operating the full HD video and bang in the middle of it,the camera is dead-something like a laptop or a computer hanging up in which the only solution is ctrl alt del...Regrettably nikon doesn't has those buttons;)...and believe it or not you have to take out the battery and reinsert it again for the camera to regain its consciousness..Its something like Tony Soprano passing out in "The Sopranos":)  I bought this camera because my first digicam was a nikon which I bought in 2005 and still use without a problem..and I love the natural image quality of it..Alas the mighty have fallen and how!!!  I want a refund and not a replacement because after researching on the net I have found hundreds of similar cases whereby even replacements of the same model S9100 have been having the same problem.Nikon R U LISTENING!!!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">Hi Folks i am gaurav, just wanted to tell you all that this is a very nice camera with mind blowing features for a very handy price. Many people encounter lag with this camera and they feel that either their piece is defective or the model is faulty but in reality this is not the case. The Memory Card that comes with this camera is usually of class 4 it means its data transfer rate is ~4Mbps (this is where problem lies) if the pic you snap is greater in size then you feel the camera is hanged so i recommend using a class 10 (20Mbps+) memory card with this camera to unleash the ultimate potential out of it, After all you deserve it because you have paid for it, right?? :)</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">I recently bought this camera,Nikon S9100 from a retailer... Look & feel wise, it is awesome... Brilliant day light photography.. for low light photography its better if you tweak the settings accordingly... 18x zoom is too good, though you need to hold the cam real steady for it to focus at full zoom... Brilliant LCD display.. nice effects,and many more...  Overall....its worth my every penny!! :D</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">I have used this camera and it is just an awesome cam........ It takes awesome full hd videos,li-ion battery,stunning looks,18x zoom. 12mp is quite good and dis might be ur best experience 2 buy it from flipkart..... Flipkart's service is just awesome ....... So going 4 dis product is a good combination of satisfaction....... The fantastic camera & de flipkart service!!!!!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">I bought the camera with high hopes... The problem i encountered while using this camera was that it froze a couple of times and i had to remove the battery and reinsert. Another issue is that the battery gets exhausted very fast.. And it takes long after that to fully charge it again... The picture quality is just satisfactory... The HD video quality is good...  But not worth your bucks....</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">Pros One of the best camera for low light pics Good zoom Light Weight Handy & Easy to use features Cons Zoom at video to be used carefully to maintain clarity in picture</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">Image clarity is very good and it is better to insert the class-10 memory card for improving the speed of camera picture making and better performance. Picture clarity is good in full zoom also but it is difficult to focus on the small object in full zoom. Battery backup also very good. Coming to size not a compact camera difficult to fit in normal size pocket compare to SLR zoom cameras size is very compact . Video quality is good in day light and night times required the full lighting. Sometimes difficult to handling the camera.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">Bought this camera in US. Easy to use with many inbuilt features, good zoom..Never faced the freezing problem which people have mentioned here. However, sometimes the snaps are not very crisp when full zoom is used, may be there is a particular way of clicking with higher zooms..</specsKey>
<specsKey="review10">Nikon Coolpix S9100 really good at features, Excellent-18X Zoom,Superb HD Video Recording, fullly loaded with features, but also have a very good flaw, it hangs up in between with No other Solution but to remove battery & restart the camera, I am surprised how a renowned company can make such a blunder. Nikon do something to correct it.</specsKey>
