<specsKey="review1">Gr8 camera for its price.... good picture quality.... gr8 HD video recording... compared it to my canon...far better then it in all respects... better lens, better finish, sturdy build quality, good flash, good battery life... easy to use, gr8 modes... ideal for persons new in photography...  all in all gr8 deal by nikon and flipkart!!!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">For the price it is a very good camera. It supports 720p video recording which is a rarity in this price range. Compared to other cameras, this camera definitely has more features. The ease of use is what made me buy it. It is to be used by my younger sister who is still in College and thus, she wanted a sassy easy to use camera. This fits all the criteria (in red color too) and finally the price is very enticing.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">A very good camera for regular use, official photography use and for new photographers. Clarity is excellent for 10.1 megapixel even in zooming to some extent. Options available to choose your pixel size thus adjusting memory consumption while saving. Video recording is average. However, clicks in poor light conditions is not very satisfactory. Another drawback is the use of AA Batteries for power. But the same has been compensated with free gift of two rechargeable batteries alongwith the charger.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">An amazing beginner's snapping machine topped with the creamy service from Flipkart, really loved it!!  You can expect to get value for each penny spent, be it the design, looks, user friendly buttons and menuâs and last but not the least the picture quality. If you are planning to give a kick start to your little hobby of freezing time through a lens, I bet, this is you tool.  The built is a bit fragile and the display is a bit noisy, in spite, you wonât find a matching piece with such featured packed and looks at this price tag.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">this camera is totally worth for money. before purchasing i have compared around 8 cameras but i found only this one the more efficient at my budget. this is good one for those who are fond of photography.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">Gr8 camera for its price.... good picture quality.... gr8 HD video recording... compared it to my sony...far better then it in all respects... better lens, better finish, good flash, good battery life...easy to use gr8 deal by nikon and flipkart!!!</specsKey>
