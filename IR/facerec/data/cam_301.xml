<specsKey="review1">I have been using this camera for 2months and I am very satisfy with the performance of this little giant of it's kind. I did a lot of research of many cameras by comparing the features, picture quality by taking picutres and viewing them in to laptop and check the clarity. Believe me this camera is the duke amont all. I have checked (SONY/CANON) with the same price range but found this is the best amont all. It gives you the real color picture that you take not like (SONY/CANON). Its picture quality is very good with CMOS censor which is used in almost all SLR cameras. Video quality is also very nice, with full HD recording 190*1080 fps. If your budget is 10k and looking for a digital camera then definitely go for this.   One think I am not completely satisfy with is the battery life should be improved a little more. Nikon should look on this part and apart from that this camera is a really nice experiance to the user and 100% value for money.  (Note- This review is based on the comparision for digital cameras/ don't compare with SLR)</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">Very handy to use. Picture clarity is fine. Even operation is also fine. I can say it ia a nice camera for those who is non-professionals but wants nice photos. One thing I need to mention here. It is taking min of 3 sec to reload the camera after the snap. So it is not possible to take immediate snaps. :(  I don't know it is a prob of NIKON or this camera..</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">Nikon S6500 is a best camera in its class and price, amazing photo quality, 12x zoom with CMOS sensor,   But the lagging point is Full HD video recording, when u do optical zoom from the camera focus and resolution degrades. Full HD seems to be VGA with no focus. secondly the battery life, the life of battery is below average. Only Half hour of full HD recording. Thirdly WiFi I don't know other is facing problem in WiFi or not but in my i phone 4s while downloading pic from camera the WiFi disconnects and download stops automatically...  Overall if u want still photos under 11k price point this is a must go camera. Nikon is always apple of my eye.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">i think the product is very good but the only thing i will say that its processor is bit slow as it takes a bit of time to recover after taking a photo but i think that the camera is excelent as i recently went to canada and from the top of the cn tower(648m) i could zoom in video and could read the license number plate of a bus going on the road below.... i would certainly suggest this to be a contender for even low end dslrs... hope it helps..</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">Very Nice Product and I'm totally satisfied!!  Pros: Very Good quality Photos and Videos can be taken Wi-Fi Sharing Freely Supplied HDMI cable Photo Effects Nikon 2 year Warranty though it is shown 1 year warranty on flipkart  Cons: Less Battery Life</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">The camera gives good quality image even in low light but is very slow. have to wait for 10 sec once u click a pic. its frustrating at times. battery capacity is low. And if the mode is changed from auto the battery drains fast. One plus is the image n video quality for the price.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">This is one of the nicest p&s camera I have come across. However the camera video recording degrades once we use zoom in between shooting. Rest of the features are awesome. Disagree with some of the reviews which say the performance is slow. Performace has been the fasted even with more than 100 pics on memory.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">Very Good camera.  Pros other brands like sony and canon cannot provide u all these feature in this price range.  Nikon is giving free HDMI cable also along with this model. But here the HDMI cable is not included.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">Hey buddy its not a touch screen camera but cheer up..nikon has a touch screen model for the same camera.. its S6400..u can find it on flipkart.. here is the link to that camera.. http://www.flipkart.com/nikon-coolpix-s6400-point-shoot/p/itmddaf6z2r4zhzc?pid=CAMDDAYSHY8TW3TX ..search manually if link fails..</specsKey>
