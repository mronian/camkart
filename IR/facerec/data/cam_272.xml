<specsKey="review1">gud quality.... worth buying it....features are also awsome...  CMOS sensor adds life to d pics... the drawback is of its continuous Auto FOcus.... it becomes hazy while zoming n recording videos but adjusts after a second or two... the mono color mode is also great. sleek looks and around battery life around 300 pics is also gud. overall 4.5 out of 5....</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">I bought this camera last week and I am totally satisfied with the performance of it, the image quality is extremely good even at night shoots.  Very few things which I see as drawbacks of this camera are:  - Location of Flash which many times comes under your finger while shooting, you would require some time to tune your mind not to put your finger over it and move away.   - Location of Power Button might also give some trouble for the new user.   - This camera can be charged even with USB cable through a PC or from cars music player which is a good feature but whats bad about it is, if you are looking to have an additional battery for this you need to buy a battery charger (MH-65) since the charger provided with the camera charges the battery without the need to take it out from the camera.  *** Overall it is really a very good camera if you can adjust with few design issues ***</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">I am a huge camera buff, i already own a nikon d90(SLR) a canon 60D(SLR) and now this... I prefer the D90 which despite it compactness provides a breathtaking 14x optical zoom, features are awesome including realtime video selective colouring and macro mode which focuses on objects as close as 1cm from the lens Overall: This is perhaps THE best compact digital point and shoot camera Rating:4.7/5.0</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">Wow!! the shipment was super fast, I received a brand new, authentic Nikon coolpix 8200 in just 2 days after the order,  I found this camera very useful for freezing my happy times with friends,family..  Thanks to flipcart!!</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">I bought Nikon Coolpix S8200 two weeks back and I would seriously advise you all to keep a distance with this camera and go for other good cameras available in market.  This camera has a serious issue and I would call it a manufacturing flaw. In Flash mode when you press shutter-release button the Flash pops up automatically and if you want to click next photo without flash, you need to turn off the Camera to lower the flash otherwise it will remain keep open although you are clicking photos in NO FLASH mode. This is the worst feature of this camera, now days in market you may find many other cameras where you can push the flash option down manually and itâs safe too. It may look a small issue but itâs very annoying when in the auto Flash mode the flash screen pops up first time and it remains open till the time you turn off your camera although you have sufficient lighting for following photos. Before buying this camera I was die heart fan of Nikon but now I would say Nikon could not provide a very basic feature in this camera to its customer. You may buy Sony DSC-HX10, its bit expensive than this but itâs worth to buy rather than this camera. One of my friends bought Sony DSC-HX10 on the same day when I bought Nikon Coolpix s8200 and now I am really regretting on my decision. In Sony DSC-HX10 you may easily push the flash option down if you switch from Flash mode to No Flash mode, you do not required to restart the camera every time or you may look for any other camera but do not waste your money on this camera.

<specsKey="review6">I have purchased this camera few days ago & it is really awesome..The pic. quality is amazing & video can be recorded in various qualities including 1080p..zoom mood also very effective & clear..I suggest u to buy it if ur budget is bellow 14k..</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">I have been using this cam for more than 1 year....... And its pretty competitive against other cams at this price list.............. It has a nice and powerfull flash light with tonnes of shooting modes....... My opinion go for it............</specsKey>
<specsKey="review8">Awesome camera to click pictures at night as the night landscape mode works quite well,picture quality is amazing even in the low light conditions.S8200 is a great buy and comes loaded with cool features....</specsKey>
<specsKey="review9">gud quality.... worth buying it....features are also awsome... Pros: 1. Very good point and shoot camera, has lot of features. 2. Worth the price. 3. Zoom is very good  he drawback is of its continuous Auto FOcus.... it becomes hazy while zoming n recording videos but adjusts after a second or two... overall rating : 8.5 out of 10.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review10">I've checked many websites & many articles that compare and tell you which camera is the best. And I've included all the cameras that are around 15k.  Just for 14k this turned out to be the winner, far beating other leading cameras.  The macro mode that lets you take focused pictures of close objects while leaving the rest of the background out of focus is AWESOME. You can even manually(using the arrow keys) point out the portion of the screen you want to focus.  After using this camera I have to say "YES, BUY THIS ONE"</specsKey>
