<specsKey="review1">Flipkart did good job in delivering the product on time. The product is perfect, except the addon free bees they promised to send. One of them was Camera Pouch. This Pouch was smaller than the camera - so the pouch was not meant for the camera I purchased - How strange!! I called Flipkart customer care, but they told that this free bee was added from the manufacturer's side, so I better call Nikon customer care. I did the same, while they told it's Flipkart's responsibility to deliver right product, they can't take care of this issue. They also added that Flipkart is not their authorized dealer. So, it has ended up into a blame game.   I expect perfection in product delivery from Flipkart. This was not expected. Hope Flipkart team can do something in this case and going forward to take care of such issues.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review2">Hi got this one just before 2 days ...picture quality is very good with and without zoom ... works well in low light condition ...flash is required only in very low light ..... back light option is one of the high light ..with 18MP and 18x , this is one of the better option compared to other models within the range ..go for it ...</specsKey>
<specsKey="review3">i bought this camera yesterday, awesome picture quality, far better than other point n shoot cameras, good in low light, CMOS sensor is superb, 18X zoom clearity is also very clear, but stability of any object only works when flash is on, if flash is not on then motion picture will blur ......</specsKey>
<specsKey="review4">Small and easy to use  RATINGS (OUT OF 5) Design 4 Features 3.5 Ease-of-use 4.5 Image quality 4 Value for money 4.5  The Nikon Coolpix S9400 is a slim and stylish digital compact camera.</specsKey>
<specsKey="review5">easy to handle..nice picture quality..nice video quality..only problem is flash which comes out while clicking a photo and battery life is also short......................................................................</specsKey>
<specsKey="review6">i bought the camera three days before...it was just awesome...very good picture quality....red eye detection....smart portrait...high zoom.....video recording with pause options are some of the vivid advantages....but there are still more options to be viewed...after having this with u....u will imagine yourself as a professional photographer....just go for it without having any doubt.....and for me the pouch fits well as i bought it in Nikon showroom....</specsKey>
<specsKey="review7">This is the best camera at this price. And to my surprise its features and performance it is better than any other camera in sub 20K bracket. I compared it with Sony, Panasonic, Cannon and Olympus before finalizing this one. The 18.x zoom is awesome and has literally no lag. Also the picture quality is superb and the colors are vivid and lively and image is very crisp and sharp and in some cases better when compared with my friends cheap SLR camera. Captures extremely nice images in low light conditions. It also has multiple shooting and editing modes. The best feature of this camera is it is charged directly like mobile and does not require a separate charger for battery. If you are looking to buy a camera, go for it.</specsKey>
